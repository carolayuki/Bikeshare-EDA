Performing an exploratory data analysis on the public datasets shared by Baywheels and DivvyBikes. My goal is to compare the differences of bike-sharing behaviours between to USA cities.

1. Markdown reporting on the SQL EDA performed to process the necessary datasets.
2. Excel spreadsheet showing all the data visualisation.
3. Video of myself briefly explaning my findings.
