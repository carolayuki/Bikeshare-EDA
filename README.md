# Bikeshare-EDA
Performing an exploratory data analysis on the public datasets shared by Baywheels and DivvyBikes. My goal is to compare the differences of bike-sharing behaviours between two USA cities.

# These are the files you will find:
1. Markdown reporting on the SQL EDA performed to process the necessary datasets.
2. Excel spreadsheet showing all the data visualisation.
3. Video of myself briefly explaning my findings.
